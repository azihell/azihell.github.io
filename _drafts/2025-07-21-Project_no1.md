# Tools of choice

After working with Qlik Sense and GCP BigQuery, I decided to try to reproduce what I achieved using open source. Working in a resourceful company made me unaware of some very important steps of the whole journey to deploy a fully functional analysis system. So at this moment I am compelled to prioritize some aspects if I want to have something to show.

### 1. Data source - Kaggle
  
I wanted to use free data provided by a reliable source. The government has an initiative [Dados Abertos](https://dados.gov.br/home) that provides data from many different sources. I chose the open data provided by [ANP](https://www.gov.br/anp/pt-br/assuntos/precos-e-defesa-da-concorrencia/precos/levantamento-de-precos-de-combustiveis-ultimas-semanas-pesquisadas) published in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paulogladson/anp-combustveis) by [Paulo Gladson](https://github.com/PauloGladson). It is the evolution of fuel price since 2004. There's some hiccups in the data but I thought it's still a nice dataset to work with, specially with the relevance of the commodity in question.

### 2. Computer programming - Python

As of now, Python stands as a very easy and strong choice for data analysis, thanks to the community that develops so many packages for this purpose. Within those packages, I specifically turned to [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [Dash](https://plotly.com/examples/), aiming for a high level of customization for both data ETL and visualization development capabilities. Little did I know I would end up dealing with **callbacks** all the time, a good code strategy also employed in programming for robotics.

### 3. Deploy
